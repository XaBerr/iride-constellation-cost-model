# IRIDE Constellation Cost Estimation Project
This repository is used to store the code used in my MBA master thesis.


## Project Overview
The IRIDE Constellation Cost Estimation project aims to estimate various costs associated with the development and operation of the IRIDE Constellation based on real public data available. This includes different categories of costs such as financing, research and development, infrastructure development, and operation expenses. The data for these costs is processed, visualized, and analyzed to provide insights into the financial aspects of the project.
